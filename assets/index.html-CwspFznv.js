You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations.</p><p>Under the hood, Next.js also abstracts and automatically configures tooling needed for React, like bundling, compiling, and more. This allows you to focus on building your application instead of spending time with configuration.</p><h2 id="core-concepts-and-features" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#core-concepts-and-features"><span>Core Concepts and Features</span></a></h2><h3 id="server-side-rendering-ssr" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#server-side-rendering-ssr"><span>Server-Side Rendering (SSR)</span></a></h3><p>Next.js can render React components on the server before sending the HTML to the client. This results in:</p><ul><li><strong>Faster Initial Load Times</strong>: Users see content much quicker, improving user experience.</li><li><strong>Improved SEO</strong>: Search engines can easily crawl and index the pre-rendered HTML, boosting search engine rankings.</li></ul><h3 id="static-site-generation-ssg" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#static-site-generation-ssg"><span>Static Site Generation (SSG)</span></a></h3><p>Next.js can generate static HTML pages at build time. These pages are then served directly to users from a CDN, leading to incredibly fast load times. SSG is ideal for content-heavy websites like blogs, documentation, or marketing sites.</p><h3 id="file-system-routing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#file-system-routing"><span>File-System Routing</span></a></h3><p>Next.js uses a file-system-based routing system. Pages are automatically created based on the files and folders in the <strong>pages</strong> directory. This makes routing intuitive and easy to manage. Dynamic routes (e.g., /blog/[id]) are also supported.</p><h3 id="api-routes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#api-routes"><span>API Routes</span></a></h3><p>Next.js allows you to create serverless functions (API routes) directly within your project. These functions can handle backend logic, data fetching, and other server-side tasks. They are often used for building APIs or interacting with databases.</p><h3 id="automatic-code-splitting" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#automatic-code-splitting"><span>Automatic Code Splitting</span></a></h3><p>Next.js automatically splits your JavaScript code into smaller chunks. This optimizes loading times by only loading the code necessary for a given page.</p><h3 id="image-optimization" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#image-optimization"><span>Image Optimization</span></a></h3><p>The built-in <code>&lt;Image&gt;</code> component automatically optimizes images for different devices and screen sizes, improving performance and user experience. It handles resizing, compression, and formatting.</p><h3 id="fast-refresh" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#fast-refresh"><span>Fast Refresh</span></a></h3><p>Next.js offers &quot;Fast Refresh,&quot; a feature that provides near-instant feedback when you make code changes. It updates the page without a full refresh, significantly speeding up development.</p><h3 id="built-in-css-support" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#built-in-css-support"><span>Built-in CSS Support</span></a></h3><p>Next.js supports CSS Modules and popular CSS-in-JS libraries, giving you flexibility in styling your applications. It also has built-in Sass support.</p><h3 id="typescript-support" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#typescript-support"><span>TypeScript Support</span></a></h3><p>Next.js has excellent TypeScript support, allowing you to use static typing to enhance code quality and maintainability.</p><h3 id="seo-enhancements" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#seo-enhancements"><span>SEO Enhancements</span></a></h3><p>Features like SSR, meta tag management, and sitemap generation help improve your website&#39;s SEO.</p><h3 id="easy-deployment" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#easy-deployment"><span>Easy Deployment</span></a></h3><p>Next.js can be easily deployed to various platforms, including Vercel (its creator), Netlify, AWS, and others.</p><h2 id="how-next-js-works" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-next-js-works"><span>How Next.js Works</span></a></h2><ul><li><strong>Development</strong>: During development, Next.js uses a development server that provides features like Fast Refresh and error reporting.</li><li><strong>Building</strong>: When you build your application for production, Next.js generates HTML files (for SSR and SSG) and JavaScript bundles.</li><li><strong>Serving</strong>: The generated files can be served from a web server or a CDN.</li><li><strong>Client-Side Hydration</strong>: When a user visits a Next.js page, the HTML is initially displayed quickly. Then, React &quot;hydrates&quot; the HTML on the client-side, making it interactive.</li></ul>',29)]))}const d=a(n,[["render",r],["__file","index.html.vue"]]),c=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/learn/front/e8IgX/","title":"NextJS","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"NextJS","createTime":"2025/02/06 22:09:58","permalink":"/learn/front/e8IgX/","author":"Jack","tags":["NextJS","React","Fullstack"],"description":null},"headers":[],"readingTime":{"minutes":1.67,"words":502},"git":{"updatedTime":1738852567000,"contributors":[{"name":"meishenlieshou","username":"meishenlieshou","email":"meishenlieshou@gmail.com","commits":1,"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/meishenlieshou?v=4","url":"https://github.com/meishenlieshou"}],"changelog":[{"hash":"fd6c099f5941c008f2d63c0dd1ecb44bb7216344","date":1738852567000,"email":"meishenlieshou@gmail.com","author":"meishenlieshou","message":"Merge branch 'main' of https://github.com/meishenlieshou/note","commitUrl":"https://github.com/meishenlieshou/note/commit/fd6c099f5941c008f2d63c0dd1ecb44bb7216344"}]},"filePathRelative":"notes/learn/react/NextJS.md","bulletin":false}`);export{d as comp,c as data};
