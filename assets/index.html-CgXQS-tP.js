It involves crafting inputs (prompts) that effectively guide the model to produce desired outputs. This process is both an art and a science, requiring a deep understanding of how models interpret and generate text.</p><h2 id="what-is-prompt-engineering" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-prompt-engineering"><span>What is Prompt Engineering</span></a></h2><p>Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining inputs to AI models to elicit specific, accurate, and useful responses. It involves:</p><ol><li>Understanding how the model interprets prompts.</li><li>Structuring prompts to guide the model’s behavior.</li><li>Iteratively testing and refining prompts to improve results.</li></ol><p>Prompt engineering is essential because LLMs are highly sensitive to the phrasing, context, and structure of inputs. A well-crafted prompt can significantly enhance the quality of the output, while a poorly designed one may lead to irrelevant or incorrect responses.</p><h2 id="why-is-prompt-engineering-important" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-is-prompt-engineering-important"><span>Why is Prompt Engineering Important?</span></a></h2><ul><li><strong>Control and Precision</strong>: Prompts allow users to steer the model toward specific tasks, such as summarization, translation, or creative writing.</li><li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: Well-designed prompts reduce the need for post-processing or manual correction of outputs.</li><li><strong>Bias Mitigation</strong>: Carefully crafted prompts can help minimize biased or harmful outputs.</li><li><strong>Customization</strong>: Prompts enable users to tailor the model’s behavior for specific applications, industries, or use cases.</li></ul><h2 id="key-concepts-in-prompt-engineering" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#key-concepts-in-prompt-engineering"><span>Key Concepts in Prompt Engineering</span></a></h2><h3 id="tokenization-and-context-windows" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#tokenization-and-context-windows"><span>Tokenization and Context Windows</span></a></h3><ul><li>LLMs process text in chunks called tokens (e.g., words, subwords, or characters).</li><li>The context window is the maximum number of tokens the model can consider at once (e.g., 4096 tokens for GPT-3).</li><li>Prompts must fit within this window while providing sufficient context for the task.</li></ul><h3 id="instruction-tuning" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#instruction-tuning"><span>Instruction Tuning</span></a></h3><ul><li>Modern LLMs are fine-tuned to follow instructions.

They help to balance the trade-off between generating diverse and coherent text.</p><ul><li><strong>Top-k Sampling</strong>: Top-k sampling involves selecting the top k most likely words from the probability distribution generated by the LLM and then sampling the next word only from this subset. For example, if k = 10, the model will only consider the 10 words with the highest probabilities for the next word.</li><li><strong>Top-p (Nucleus Sampling)</strong>: Top-p sampling, also known as nucleus sampling, selects a dynamic set of words based on their cumulative probability. The model sorts the words by probability and keeps adding words to the set until the cumulative probability reaches a threshold p. For example, if p = 0.9, the model will keep adding words until the sum of their probabilities reaches 90%. Then, it samples the next word from this set.</li></ul></div><h2 id="techniques-for-effective-prompt-engineering" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#techniques-for-effective-prompt-engineering"><span>Techniques for Effective Prompt Engineering</span></a></h2><h3 id="be-explicit-and-specific" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#be-explicit-and-specific"><span><mark>Be Explicit and Specific</mark></span></a></h3><h3 id="use-examples-few-shot-learning" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#use-examples-few-shot-learning"><span><mark>Use Examples (Few-Shot Learning)</mark></span></a></h3><h3 id="chain-of-thought-cot-prompting" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chain-of-thought-cot-prompting"><span><mark>Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting</mark></span></a></h3><h3 id="role-playing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#role-playing"><span><mark>Role-Playing</mark></span></a></h3><h3 id="iterative-refinement" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#iterative-refinement"><span><mark>Iterative Refinement</mark></span></a></h3><h3 id="use-constraints" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#use-constraints"><span><mark>Use Constraints</mark></span></a></h3>',24)]))}const h=t(s,[["render",o],["__file","index.html.vue"]]),p=JSON.parse('{"path":"/learn/ai/bnM4LpSL50FxDZ6wid/","title":"Prompt Engineering","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Prompt Engineering","createTime":"2025/02/08 19:00:38","permalink":"/learn/ai/bnM4LpSL50FxDZ6wid/","author":"Jack","tags":["ai","Prompt Engineering","chatgpt","gemini"],"description":"description"},"headers":[],"readingTime":{"minutes":2.03,"words":610},"git":{"updatedTime":1739015285000,"contributors":[{"name":"meishenlieshou","username":"meishenlieshou","email":"meishenlieshou@gmail.com","commits":1,"avatar":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/meishenlieshou?v=4","url":"https://github.com/meishenlieshou"}],"changelog":[{"hash":"d78d8cd7f45e9a57c1f0691612f9cb45d248d256","date":1739015285000,"email":"meishenlieshou@gmail.com","author":"meishenlieshou","message":"commit","commitUrl":"https://github.com/meishenlieshou/note/commit/d78d8cd7f45e9a57c1f0691612f9cb45d248d256"}]},"filePathRelative":"notes/learn/ai/Prompt Engineering.md","bulletin":false}');export{h as comp,p as data};
